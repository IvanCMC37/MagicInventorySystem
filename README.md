You have franchises in five locations around Melbourne. One in Melbourne CBD and 4 other
locations in Melbourne servicing the North, East, South and West areas of Melbourne. Each
store sells to both retail (the public) and wholesale to registered Magicians.

The system must accommodate three types of users: Owner (You), Franchise Owner (for
each store), and Customers (Wholesale / Retail).

The Owner is responsible for supplying the Franchise Stores with stock when requested.

The Franchise Owner should be able to check their inventory and request stock
replenishment. Each store can carry distinct products selected from the ownerâ€™s inventory

The Retail Customer can purchase products. There will be no prices involved when
purchasing products in this assignment. The only way a purchase can fail is if the item being
purchased has an insufficient stock level for the quantity requested.
